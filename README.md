codeinterview
=============

Hosted on http://codeinterview.herokuapp.com

Based on the Heroku node.js sample: https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample


Plan
====

A site like seemikecode.com, with:
- WebSockets (socket.io) to push changes quickly
- WebKit notifications to tell you when your interviewee has connected
- the ability to set questions in advance

Reason
======

I give interviews at work a couple of times a week.  The ability to easily test if a candidate can write a "hello world"
program before calling them to interview would be good.
Also, I want to play with node.js :)
